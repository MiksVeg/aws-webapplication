### Steps to Build the Project:


* Create a DynamoDB table to store the items as view count. 
* Build a Lambda function to handle the view count operations on the DynamoDB table. 
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). 
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. 

### Expected Outcome:

Upon completing the project, you will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS.
Every time you refresh the webpage, the view count will increase.

This project will help you improve your skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
